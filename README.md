declarative `language` that will support a basic functional style.**








Purpose of work Gain experience in programming using multi-paradigm programming and preparing your own declarative language that will support a basic functional style.

## Task üõ†Ô∏è

<table>
<tr>
<td>

Implement a simple interpreter in C++ that can evaluate arithmetic expressions, define functions, and call functions. The interpreter should support the following features:

- Basic arithmetic operations: +, -, *, /
- Function definitions with two parameters (pow, abs, max, min)
- Expression combinations
- Function calls (combination of the above expressions with a dedicated name)
- Variables saving for reusing them (var a = pow(2, 4))

## **Testing**üõ†Ô∏è 


To test the implemented interpreter, you should implement a python script that will execute your
program with different input combinations and then it should verify the correctness of the result.

## Example C++ program:

   ```sh
    #include <iostream>
    #include <string>
    int main()
    {
     std::string input;
     std::getline(std::cin, input); // Read input from stdin
     // Echo back the input
     std::cout << "Echo: " << input << std::endl;
     return 0;
    }
```


## Example python script for testing (test_script.py):

   ```sh
    import subprocess
    def run_echo(input_data):
     process = subprocess.Popen(
     ['myprogram.exe'],
     stdin=subprocess.PIPE,
     stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
     stderr=subprocess.PIPE,
     text=True
     )
     stdout, stderr = process.communicate(input_data)
     return stdout.strip(), stderr.strip()
    def test_echo():
     tests = [
     {
     "input": "Hello, world!\n",
     "expected_output": "Echo: Hello, world!"
     },
     {
     "input": "12345\n",
   "expected_output": "Echo: 12345"
    },
     {
     "input": "Testing echo program\n",
     "expected_output": "Echo: Testing echo program"
     }
     # Add more test cases as needed
     ]
     for test in tests:
     input_data = test["input"]
     expected_output = test["expected_output"]
    
     output, error = run_echo(input_data)
    
     if error:
     print(f"Test failed for input:\n{input_data}")
     print(f"Error:\n{error}")
     elif output.strip() != expected_output:
     print(f"Test failed for input:\n{input_data}")
     print(f"Expected:\n{expected_output}")
     print(f"Got:\n{output}")
     else:
     print(f"Test passed for input:\n{input_data}")
    if __name__ == "__main__":
     test_echo()
```

## Execution:

   ```sh
  > py.exe .\test_script.py
  Test passed for input:
  Hello, world!
  Test passed for input:
  12345
  Test passed for input:
  Testing echo program

```


## Immutability: Data structures and variables are not modified once created.
o Python

```sh
# Immutable list in Python
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```

o Haskell
```sh
-- Immutable list in Haskell
numbers :: [Int]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```


## Pure Functions:

o Python

```sh
# A pure function in Python
def square(x):
 return x * x
```

o Haskell
```sh
-- Immutable list in Haskell
numbers :: [Int]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

## Higher-Order Function

o Python

```sh
# Higher-order function in Python
def apply_function(f, x):
 return f(x)
# Using the higher-order function
def square(x):
 return x * x
result = apply_function(square, 5)
```

o Haskell
```sh
-- Higher-order function in Haskell
applyFunction :: (a -> b) -> a -> b
applyFunction f x = f x
-- Using the higher-order function
square :: Int -> Int
square x = x * x
result = applyFunction square 5
```

## Referential Transparency:

o Python

```sh
# Referential transparency in Python
def add(a, b):
 return a + b
x = 5
y = 3
result = add(x, y)
```

o Haskell
```sh
-- Referential transparency in Haskell
add :: Int -> Int -> Int
add a b = a + b
x :: Int
x = 5
y :: Int

y = 3
result :: Int
result = add x y

```

## Using Anonymous/Lambda Functions: 


o Python

```sh
# Anonymous (lambda) function in Python
multiply_by_two = lambda x: x * 2
```

o Haskell
```sh
-- Anonymous (lambda) function in Haskell
multiplyByTwo :: Int -> Int
multiplyByTwo = \x -> x * 2

```


## Example functional-styled program

```sh
from functools import reduce
# Define a pure function to square a number
def square(x):
 return x * x
# Define a pure function to check if a number is even
def is_even(x):
 return x % 2 == 0
# Define a pure function to calculate the sum of squares of even numbers
def sum_of_squares_of_evens(numbers):
 # Filter even numbers
 evens = filter(is_even, numbers)

 # Square each even number
 squared_evens = map(square, evens)

 # Use reduce to sum the squared even numbers
 total = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, squared_evens)
 return total
# Example Input
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
# Calculate the sum of squares of even numbers
result = sum_of_squares_of_evens(numbers)
# Output the result
print(result) # Output: 56
```

An `interpreter` is a program that executes code written in a high-level programming language. It
processes the code line by line, interpreting and executing it as it goes, which is different from a
compiler that translates the entire code into machine code before execution.


 `Functional programming`is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of
mathematical functions. Key principles include:

`Pure Functions`: Functions that produce the same output for the same input, with no side effects on other program parts, the function doesn‚Äôt modify program‚Äôs state.

`Higher-Order Functions`:Functions can take other functions as arguments or return them.


`Referential Transparency`: Expressions can be replaced with their values without
changing the program's behavior. This property is a key aspect of functional programming,
as it simplifies reasoning about code and facilitates optimization. In both code examples
function calls can be replaced with their computed values, and it won't change the behavior
of the program.

### Functional paradigms can be implemented in code through the following techniques:
- Defining pure functions that don't modify state or produce side effects.
- Using higher-order functions to create composable and reusable code.
- Embracing immutability by not modifying data in place.
